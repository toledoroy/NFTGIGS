> A decentralized permissionless gig matketplace where anyone can post their products and services

Built for ETHGlobal Road to Web3 Hackathon

NFT Gigs is like fiverr for web3. It's distributed and permissionless and anyone can post products and services. It can be also be used as a backend for any web3 eCommerce applications and storefronts. 


At the core of the project is a self-selling escrow ERC1155 smart contract that manages the entire offer lifecycle (purchase, order, delivery, review...) on chain and never makes any mistakes.
This contract is lightweight and efficient. It only holds the meaningful data while additional data can be added to IPFS and emited as events. 
From there we can just use the data like conventional web2 application.
